# FashionMNIST Classification Model
This project features a deep learning model built using the FashionMNIST dataset to classify grayscale images of clothing items into their respective categories. The model is designed for high accuracy and robust automated fashion recognition.
## Features
- Uses FashionMNIST dataset (10 clothing categories)
- Preprocessing: normalization and resizing
- Deep learning architecture (specify CNN/MLP if relevant)
- High accuracy for image classification
- Ready-to-use for research or demonstration
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rageya/FashionMNIST.git
cd FashionMNIST
```
2. Follow installation instructions.
3. Run the model training and inference scripts.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- numpy, matplotlib
